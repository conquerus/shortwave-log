* Shortwave log
** Overview
This is an Org-mode file that I use to generate the log of my
shortwave contacts.  It is an example of [[https://justin.abrah.ms/emacs/literate_programming.html][literate programming]] since
the code and prose are coupled. It uses a Python script (via
Org-babel) to generate a map of the transmitter locations with Python
using information from the table. The Python script requires =numpy=,
=basemap=, and =matplotlib=.
